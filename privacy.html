    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Rootwell ("the App") is developed by Yves Muheim ("we", "us", "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Rootwell does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All app data — including focus sessions, settings, streaks, and preferences — is stored locally on your device and never leaves it.</p>

    <h2>No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
    <p>We do not use any analytics services, tracking tools, advertising SDKs, or third-party data processors. We do not track your usage, location, or behavior in any way.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Rootwell offers a one-time premium upgrade via Apple's In-App Purchase system. All payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. We do not have access to your payment information, Apple ID, or any financial data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs that collect user data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Rootwell does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The App does not require any personal information to function.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device using Apple's on-device frameworks (SwiftData and UserDefaults). If you delete the App, all associated data is permanently removed from your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
